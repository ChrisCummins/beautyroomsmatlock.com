# Natural Wear

Perfect for daily wear or for an active lifestyle. You can shower,
swin, spa and sleep problem free because eyelash extensions are
waterproof and durable. You can enjoy having long, beautiful and
thicker lashes 24 hours a day and for weeks at a time without hassle,
inconvenience or the need for mascara.

# Natural Look

These luscious lashes are so natural that no one will ever know the
difference. They have a natural curl so you can throw away your
eyelash curler. Lash Perfect come in various thicknesses, colours and
lengths to beautifully blend with your own lashes and to suit your
sense of style.

# Natural Feel

When professionally and properly applied, these lightweight lashes
feel just like your own.

# Semi-Permanent

Lash Perfect extensions are semi-permanent, lasting up to 8-12 weeks
depending on the life cycle of your own natural lashes and regular
maintenance. You will increase the time you can keep your lashes with
2-3 weekly top ups. Like your nails and the hair on your head, your
individual eyelashes grow out on a continuous cycle of
replenishment. Lash Perfect are available in different weights to
ensure your nautral lash is completely protected and to give a natural
look and feel.
